A program that challenges the user to estimate a random number after it is generated. "Lower number please!!" appears if the player predicts a higher number. Likewise, "Higher number please!!" appears if the player predicts a lower number. The amount of guesses the player made to get at the number is displayed after they predict the correct number.
